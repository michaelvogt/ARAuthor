<h1>Welcome at Izumo Grand Shrine</h1>
<div><img id="header" src="./images/izumotaishamasthead.webp"/></div>
<p>Izumo-taisha (出雲大社, Izumo Grand Shrine), officially Izumo Ōyashiro, is one of the most
    ancient and important Shinto shrines in Japan. No record gives the date of establishment.
    Located in Izumo, Shimane Prefecture, it is home to two major festivals. It is dedicated to
    the god Ōkuninushi (大国主大神, Ōkuninushi-no-ōkami), famous as the Shinto deity of marriage and
    to Kotoamatsukami, distinguishing heavenly kami. The shrine is believed by many to be the
    oldest Shinto shrine in Japan, even predating the Ise Grand Shrine.</p>

<p>A style of architecture, taisha-zukuri, takes its name from the main hall of Izumo-taisha.
    That hall, and the attached buildings, were designated National Treasures of Japan in 1952.
    According to tradition, the hall was previously much taller than at present. The discovery
    in the year 2000 of the remains of enormous pillars has lent credence to this.</p>

<p>Several other buildings in the shrine compound are on the list of Important Cultural
    Properties of Japan.</p>
