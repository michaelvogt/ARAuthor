<h1>Welcome to Iwami Ginzan</h1>
<div><img id="header" src="./images/iwamiginzanmasthead.webp"/></div>
<p>The Iwami Ginzan (石見銀山) was an underground silver mine in the city of Ōda, in Shimane Prefecture
    on the main island of Honshu, Japan.[1] It was the largest silver mine in Japanese history. It
    was active for almost four hundred years, from its discovery in 1526 to its closing in 1923.</p>

<p>The mines, mining structures, and surrounding cultural landscape — listed as the "Iwami Ginzan
    Silver Mine and its Cultural Landscape" — became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.</p>
