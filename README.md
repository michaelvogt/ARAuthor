Experiment with the image recognition feature of ARCore

This is a prototype for an application that should provide tourist with information about historical sites using augmented reality (AR).

AR makes it possible to extend the display space of regular information boards to provie more information and let tourist explore deeper about topics they are interest in.

Right now, this application is developed for the world heritage site Iwami Ginzan in Japan. But the aim is, that it should be applicable all over the world at equally structures places. 

Work has started to provide a first prototype through Google's play store.

Collaborators are highly welcome.
