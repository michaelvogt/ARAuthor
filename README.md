# ARAuthor

Currently not working on this app anymore, because of the shortcoming of ARCore and the perceived unwillingness of Google to fix even the simplest bugs and implement requested features. Will continue as soon as one of the ARCloud frameworks are available for Android apps.

Started to work with Immersal, which requires Unity for development right now. But access to the SDK though native apps is announced.

Also, the architecture I'd like to use here is hard to get working. Some api's in Android jetpack need updates to get there. Such updates have been announced by Google during the Google I/O for early next year.


Regarding the current state:
Experiment with the image recognition feature of ARCore

This is a prototype for an application that should provide tourist with information about historical sites using augmented reality (AR).

AR makes it possible to extend the display space of regular information boards to provie more information and let tourist explore deeper about topics they are interest in.

Right now, this application is developed for the world heritage site Iwami Ginzan in Japan. But the aim is, that it should be applicable all over the world at equally structures places. 

Work has started to provide a first prototype through Google's play store.

Collaborators are highly welcome.
