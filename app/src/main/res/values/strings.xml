    <string name="app_name">AR Author</string>
    <string name="app_intro">This app is a playground for Augmented Reality functionality around
        ARCore from Google. Currently mainly based around the image marker functionality.\n\n

        It allows to capture marker images, crop them and try them out on the spot, to make sure
        the captures images are actually usable for the ARCore recognition engine.\n\n

        Next step is to provide simple authoring functionality to define areaIds on the marker image
        and place interactive elements to sketch out some scene ideas, that can then be implemented
        for a specific application.\n\n

        When required functionality is available, the functionality of this app will be provided
        as a browser app.
