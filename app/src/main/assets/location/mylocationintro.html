<h1>Welcome to my Location</h1>
<div><img id="header" src="./images/mylocationmasthead.webp"/></div>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to try out this application. </p>
<p>So far, only general functionality is available. The purpose for the app is to get feedback and
    allow AR feature experimentation.</p>
<p>The long term aim is to provide a crowd sourced AR experience for tourists all over the world.
    The current functionality is the beginning of the editing part. AR features are provided
    through dynamic modules developed separately from the application.</p>
<p>While this application is currently an Android application, this will change as soon as the
    required AR features are available by web browsers.</p>
<p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/michaelvogt/ARAuthor">Github</a></p>

<h2>Starter "Hello World" AR feature</h2>
<p>Tab button below, find a horizontal or vertical plane by pointing the camera towards a table, or
    so, and moving the phone slowly left and right, until you see dots on a plane. Then tab on the
    plane. Then you should see a 'big old house' sitting on this plane.</p>
<p>Next: Check out the navigation menu at the bottom left to find out about the other features.</p>
