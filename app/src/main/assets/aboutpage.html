<h1>About TouristAR</h1>
<h2>Aim:</h2>
<p>Let tourists recognize and learn about the history and cultural value of objects around them at
    locations like world heritage registered sites using modern technologies like AR, AI and 3D
    visualizations.</p>

<h2>Idea:</h2>
<p>At tourist locations, it is usually very hard to understand the history and cultural value of the
    area and objects at the current location. Joining tours is often a bad experience, as the tour
    guide just replays what he was taught by the local tourist organisation. Even worse, tour groups
    are often large, so individual questions can't be answered. Tourist AR aims to provide a tool to
    tourists that allows them to find places that are interesting to them in their own, individual
    speed and depth.</p>

<h2>Group application:</h2>
<p>I believe, AR technology has an enormous potential to help people to experience their surrounding
    in a much more exciting, individualized way. Objects around them, currently completely ignored,
    can be brought to live, telling their (hi)story, educate or entertain.</p>

<p>The project I'm working on could bring historical sites to live, allowing tourists to experience
    visits to such places in a much more enjoyable and memorable way. Potentially changing the shape
    of tourism to become more individualized, capable to provide useful information on the spot.</p>

<p>The great computing power of the devices literally everybody is carrying around, advances in
    natural language processing, machine learning and 3D visualisation, all comes together with AR.
    The one missing technology that missing is the ARCloud, which is being worked on right now.</p>

<p>To take advantage of all this potential in a meaningful way, needs of course the collaboration of
    many people of different fields and the right resources. Any help is welcome.</p>
